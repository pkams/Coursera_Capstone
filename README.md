# Coursera_Capstone
This repository will be mainly used for the capstone project of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The goal of this study was to create a code that communicates with the foursquare API and segments the city of Curitiba based on the types of places in each neighborhood.

Due to the fact that the city has very similar neighborhoods (so the characteristic matrix has become too sparse), we are left with a very large segment and some small ones. The idea is to change this code in the future by analyzing other ways of weighing each feature.

The inicial concept of this study was enough to pass the DATA SCIENCE CERTIFICATE FROM IBM!
